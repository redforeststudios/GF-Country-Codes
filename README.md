A full list of all country names w/ their ISO two letter country codes for use in a Gravity Forms dropdown field. Put this together due to a bug in the current release (2.8.3) that breaks the code snippets from the official docs (https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_countries/) that add country code values. Just copy/paste using the 'bulk add choices' tool.
